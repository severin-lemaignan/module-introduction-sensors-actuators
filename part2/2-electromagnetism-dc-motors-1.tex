\begin{frame}{Introducing the Code Golf}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each week, a coding challenge (in Python or C++)
        \item Submit your code online on the DLE for some quick feedback
        \item I'll pick one submission to show everyone one possible solution
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sharpen your programming skills
        \item For the fun
        \item Not assessed
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{This week's challenge}

\note{

In a very general frame motors can be considered as energy converters.
DC motors convert the electrical input power (DC voltage V and current
I) into mechanical output power consisting of angular speed Ï and torque
M. Engineers prefer to use rotational speed n measured in rpm instead of
rad/s; that's why there is a factor of Ï/30 to get the unit of power
right in Watts.

The theory described in this presentation applies to any DC motor, in
particular to the maxon DC motor and the brushless maxon EC motor.

\note{
This picture shows a coreless maxon DC motor. We recognize the same
three subassemblies as with the conventional motor.

The \textbf{stator} consists of the permanent magnet at the centre (here
shown in green), of the housing (again serving as the magnetic return)
and of the mounting flange.

The \textbf{rotor} with winding and commutator. The winding is connected
to the shaft by the so called commutator plate. In this example the
shaft is supported in the stator by ball bearings. The shape of the
rotor reminds of a Xmas bell; that's why it is sometimes called ``bell
shaped'' armature. The winding moves in the air gap between magnet and
housing.

The \textbf{brush system} here with graphite brushes in red and with the
electrical motor connections.

The next slides show the advantages of a ironless motor design.

\note{

After this introduction let's now consider the magnetic circuit in the
stator in more detail.

This slides shows a cross section of the stator.

In the centre we have the \textbf{permanent magnet}. It is diametrically
magnetized, the north pole being colored in red, the south pole in
green. The bore in the middle serves for the motor shaft.

The \textbf{magnetic field lines} leave the magnet at the north pole and
enter the magnet at the south pole. Magnetic field lines - more exactly
the magnetic induction B - are closed lines and must be guided back from
the north to the south pole. That's the duty of the housing which is
made of a magnetically conducting material. That's why the housing is
also called \textbf{magnetic return}.

Between the permanent magnet and the magnetic return the field lines
point in radial direction in the \textbf{air gap}. The goal of this
arrangement is to create an magnetic field as strong as possible in the
air gap in order for the winding to produce as much force as possible.
Air is a bad magnetic conductor and the larger the air gap the smaller
the magnetic flux that can be built. That's why the air gap should be as
narrow as possible. However in a narrow air gap there is room for only a
thin walled winding. The current density is small and so is the produced
force. We see that finding the right dimensions for the air gap is a
classic optimization problem depending strongly on the properties of the
permanent magnet.

In short: We have a configuration producing a magnetic field in the air
gap which points from bottom to top in this representation.

    \note{

Coreless DC motors have \textbf{no iron losses}.

In a conventional design the iron core permanently changes its
magnetization. This consumes energy because the magnetic hysteresis loop
must be run through at each shaft rotation. Additionally these flux
variations induce Eddy currents in the iron core resulting in power
losses that grow with the square of the motor speed.

By contrast, in a coreless motor the Magnetization is permanently
impressed and constant. (The influence of the magnetic field of the
winding can be neglected in a first approximation.) Hence there are no
iron losses. As a result, the power losses are smaller, the
\textbf{efficiency is higher} and the \textbf{no-load current is lower}.

In an ironless design \textbf{no saturation} at the narrow parts of the
iron core (at the base of the teeth) can occur. Hence the produced
torque remains \textbf{exactly proportional} to the motor current and
one can use the strongest permanent magnets without being limited by the
maximum magnetic flux in the iron core. Improvements in magnet
technology lead to \textbf{stronger motors}.
