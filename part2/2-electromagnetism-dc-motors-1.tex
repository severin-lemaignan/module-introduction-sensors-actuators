electromagnetic torque because of mechanical losses

    \begin{frame}{Electronic commutation systems}
    \note {
In this third part of the presentation we would like to understand the electronic commutation.
There are different systems. maxon uses the following three :

- Block commutation with or without Hall sensors
- Sinusoidal commutation.

As you can see the different maxon controller families perform different commutation types.

Common to all these systems is that they should apply the current in a way, that the generated torque is as high as possible. As we have learned this is achieved by a perpendicular orientation of the magnetic fields of permanent magnet and winding. We have seen as well that we need to know the orientation of the permanent magnet to achieve this.

We start with block commutation with Hall sensor position feedback. That's the standard commutation type. Once we have understood this the two other commutation schemes are easily derived from it.

{\fullbackground[scale=0.9,page=22]{../part1/figs/ian-sensors.pdf}
    \begin{frame}{Block commutation}

\note{
First we have to look at the Hall sensor feedback signals. Again we do this
based on the simplest design, the slotless maxon EC motor with 1 pole pair.

In the back of the motor there are three Hall sensor mounted on the PCB at an
angle of 120Â°. The Hall sensor detect the magnetic poles of the control magnet
which is mounted on the shaft. The control magnet exhibits the same two
magnetic poles in the same orientation as the power magnet. (Basically the Hall
sensors could monitor the power magnet directly but the control magnet offers
two advantages: The magnetic transitions between north and south pole are more
precisely defined. And an angular misalignment and tolerances between the
relative position of winding and Hall sensors can be adjusted.)

The digital Hall sensors used probe the direction of the magnetic field. They
generates a high output signal (5V) if the north pole of the control magnet is
close to them. A south pole produces a low level (Gnd).

The actual position of the control magnet in the diagram generates the
following signals:

- The blue Hall sensor sees the north pole. Thus the signal output level is
high and will remain high for the next 120Â°.
- The green Hall sensor is close to the south pole. The output level is low for
the next 60Â°. Then the north pole approaches and the output signal will switch
to a high state.
- The red Hall sensor has just switched from high to low where the signal level
will stay for the next half a turn.

The combination of the three Hall sensor signals is unique for each 60Â° of
rotation. Looking at these signals allows to know the rotor position within
60Â°. That exactly what we need for commutation. Remember there were 6 different
ways of current flow through the motor at a commutation angle of 60Â°.

The next slide shows how the complete block commutation system works.

    \begin{frame}{Components of an EC drive system}
\note{
Let's first look at an EC drive system in general.

The three phases of the EC motor cannot be connected directly to a DC power
supply. The voltage needs to be switched in a sequence. This is done by the
electronic commutation. For the correct switching the electronics needs rotor
position information from the motor. This information is usually provided by
the Hall sensors.

An EC motor cannot operate on its own: It's always the combination of motor and
electronics commutation that makes the full drive.


For more sophisticated commutation and precise motor control, e.g. at very low
speeds, the use of an encoder feedback might be necessary. Often the
electronics not only performs the commutation but at the same time can be used
to control speed or position.

\note{

In a very general frame motors can be considered as energy converters.
DC motors convert the electrical input power (DC voltage V and current
I) into mechanical output power consisting of angular speed Ï and torque
M. Engineers prefer to use rotational speed n measured in rpm instead of
rad/s; that's why there is a factor of Ï/30 to get the unit of power
right in Watts.

The theory described in this presentation applies to any DC motor, in
particular to the maxon DC motor and the brushless maxon EC motor.

\note{
This picture shows a coreless maxon DC motor. We recognize the same
three subassemblies as with the conventional motor.

The \textbf{stator} consists of the permanent magnet at the centre (here
shown in green), of the housing (again serving as the magnetic return)
and of the mounting flange.

The \textbf{rotor} with winding and commutator. The winding is connected
to the shaft by the so called commutator plate. In this example the
shaft is supported in the stator by ball bearings. The shape of the
rotor reminds of a Xmas bell; that's why it is sometimes called ``bell
shaped'' armature. The winding moves in the air gap between magnet and
housing.

\note{

After this introduction let's now consider the magnetic circuit in the
stator in more detail.

This slides shows a cross section of the stator.

In the centre we have the \textbf{permanent magnet}. It is diametrically
magnetized, the north pole being colored in red, the south pole in
green. The bore in the middle serves for the motor shaft.

The \textbf{magnetic field lines} leave the magnet at the north pole and
enter the magnet at the south pole. Magnetic field lines - more exactly
the magnetic induction B - are closed lines and must be guided back from
the north to the south pole. That's the duty of the housing which is
made of a magnetically conducting material. That's why the housing is
also called \textbf{magnetic return}.

Between the permanent magnet and the magnetic return the field lines
point in radial direction in the \textbf{air gap}. The goal of this
arrangement is to create an magnetic field as strong as possible in the
air gap in order for the winding to produce as much force as possible.
Air is a bad magnetic conductor and the larger the air gap the smaller
the magnetic flux that can be built. That's why the air gap should be as
narrow as possible. However in a narrow air gap there is room for only a
thin walled winding. The current density is small and so is the produced
force. We see that finding the right dimensions for the air gap is a
classic optimization problem depending strongly on the properties of the
permanent magnet.

In short: We have a configuration producing a magnetic field in the air
gap which points from bottom to top in this representation.

    \note{

Coreless DC motors have \textbf{no iron losses}.

In a conventional design the iron core permanently changes its
magnetization. This consumes energy because the magnetic hysteresis loop
must be run through at each shaft rotation. Additionally these flux
variations induce Eddy currents in the iron core resulting in power
losses that grow with the square of the motor speed.

By contrast, in a coreless motor the Magnetization is permanently
impressed and constant. (The influence of the magnetic field of the
winding can be neglected in a first approximation.) Hence there are no
iron losses. As a result, the power losses are smaller, the
\textbf{efficiency is higher} and the \textbf{no-load current is lower}.

In an ironless design \textbf{no saturation} at the narrow parts of the
iron core (at the base of the teeth) can occur. Hence the produced
torque remains \textbf{exactly proportional} to the motor current and
one can use the strongest permanent magnets without being limited by the
maximum magnetic flux in the iron core. Improvements in magnet
technology lead to \textbf{stronger motors}.
